To install this package from source:

1. Windows users may need to install the Rtools and include the checkbox option of installing Rtools to their path for easier command line usage. Mac users will have to download the necessary tools from the Xcode and its related command line tools (found within Xcodeâ€™s Preference Pane under Downloads/Components); most Linux distributions should already have up to date compilers (or if not they can be updated easily).

2. Install the devtools package (if necessary), and install the package from the Github source code.

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JihongZ/StanDCM")
```
